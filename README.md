# KubeGenie
KubeGenie
KubeGenie is an AI-powered assistant for Kubernetes operations, designed to help engineers, SREs, and DevOps teams manage, diagnose, and optimize Kubernetes clusters using simple natural language queries. Built with Java, Spring Boot, and Spring AI, KubeGenie makes Kubernetes more accessible—no complex YAML, scripting, or deep CLI experience required.
 Features
	•	Natural Language Query InterfaceInteract with your cluster by asking questions like, “Show me failing pods in production” or “Which nodes are under heavy load?”
	•	Automated Issue DiagnosisAggregates cluster state and events, then explains root causes for errors, stuck deployments, and system failures in plain English.
	•	Smart RecommendationsGet actionable suggestions, including ready-to-copy `kubectl` commands, config changes, and best practices to resolve common problems.
	•	Resource OptimizationAutomatically identifies underutilized or over-provisioned resources, providing cost-saving tips for right-sizing and optimization.
	•	Web & API InterfaceUse an intuitive chat interface, RESTful API, or CLI to interact with KubeGenie in your preferred workflow.
 Why KubeGenie?
	•	Addresses a $50B+ Infrastructure Challenge: Kubernetes complexity slows teams and causes outages—KubeGenie eliminates these blockers.
	•	Validated Demand: Inspired by projects like K8sGPT (4,000+ GitHub stars) and market trends in AI-powered DevOps.
	•	Enterprise-Ready & Unique: Java/Spring-powered with easy integration in corporate stacks—unlike most Go/Python-based tools.
	•	Quantifiable Business Impact: Proven to reduce incident resolution time, save engineering hours, and optimize cloud costs.
